# helium-prediction
Using Python and TensorFlow to predict prices of the cryptocurrency HNT

This is an ongoing side project. I've finished the exploratory data analysis which you can see in the exploreData.ipynb file. Next, I'll create a multivariate, single step LSTM model, then a LSTM multivariate, multistep model, and after that I will do a hyperparameter search to improve the multivariate, multistep LSTM model.
